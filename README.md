#About LockdownBrowser-HeadDetection

This is a lockdown browser for students to use when testing off-site/remote. Screen monitoring & video monitoring are a standard these days - this program monitors the angle of the participants head is at and will notate a violation if the users head exceeds a certain angle. I trained the model with a degree tolerance around 65-70 degrees left/right with 0 deg being the focal point/web-cam area. 

This is mainly a fun mini-project for me to delve into ML; however, this is a few months old at this point in time that I'm committing it to github.

#How To Use?
This uses NodeJS but you will not see it in this repo. It's a simple installation - PM me for assistance!
