--About--
This is a lockdown browser for students to use when testing off-site/remote. What sets this system apart is its ability to track the participant's head position, flagging any violations if the head angle exceeds a predefined threshold. The machine learning model has been trained with a tolerance of approximately 65-70 degrees to the left or right, with 0 degrees serving as the focal point aligned with the webcam. This ensures a balanced approach to monitoring while allowing for natural movement within an acceptable range.

--This is mainly a fun mini-project for me to delve into ML; however, this is a few months old at this point in time that I'm committing it to github--

--How To Use?--
This uses NodeJS but you will not see it in this repo. It's a simple installation - PM me for assistance!
